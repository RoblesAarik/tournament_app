## What this app solves

A sports app that lets teams and leagues create, setup and check events.

I wanted create an app that allows people to create and hold event for sports groups. People that sign up are able to create events and edit their events by adding teams and changing tournament info.

## Who would use it

- Event creators
- Coaches and players
- Parents

## Things to come back to

- Edit teams

- Add different sports thast can be filtered or searched
